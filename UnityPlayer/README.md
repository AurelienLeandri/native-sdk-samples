- After the project is loaded, go to the Project panel
- Got into the folder Scenes and click Interface.scene
- Click Play

In the application, a playlist is loaded by default. You can change the content in the input text field and load it by clicking on the "Go" button.

You can load 3 types of content:

```
album/CODE
playlist/CODE
track/CODE
```

If no track is loaded, that means that either the tracklist is unavailable or only for premium users.
